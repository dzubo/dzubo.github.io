Hey, check this out! 

Here is [my presentation][pres] for the [Vancouver Learn Data Science meetup][learn-ds-meetup].

BTW, I highly recommend this meetup. It has two incarnations:
Learn Data Science by Doing Kaggle Competitions is for those who interested in starting
doing Data Science, another one - [Advanced] Data Science Reading Group for more experienced data scientists.
The atmosphere is very welcome and the number of the participants is constantly growing.

On March 9th, 2017, I'll do overview and describe some solutions for the Avito Detect Duplicate Ads Kaggle competition.
